# horiseon-code-refactor

## description

I wanted to take something that was there and help to make it better. By adding code where needed and taking and consolidating where needed to make the code more streamline.
Fixed the html to provide working links, and restructured css to follow the semantic flow of the html.
I learned how make a clickable link on a webpage work and how to take code that was repeated and make it into a more ingestable structure. also how to title a page for the end user to see.
